		<h1>Welcome to Trigger!</h1>
		
		<p>What is Trigger? Trigger is a simple yet powerful add-on for ExpressionEngine 2 that allows you to quickly and easily access EE's functionality through a command-line interface.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a very simple example:</p>
		
		<pre><code>ee : site : offline</code></pre>
		
		<p>This command turns the site offline. Simple enough, right? The nice thing about this is that using the Trigger accessory, you can access this command anywhere you are in EE, instantly, without having to leave the page you're on. Cool, eh?</p>
		
		<p>But it doesn't stop there. While that may be a very simple example of a Trigger command, you can do lots of things with Trigger. You can even build entire site structures using Trigger. Best of all? It can all be automated.</p>
		
		<p>To get started with Trigger, start with the menu below. Happy building!</p>
